# portfolio-from-scratch

## Description

This is a portfolio website that I created from scratch. The navigation bar redirects you to the corresponding sections of the page. Pressing Resume in the Nav Bar will redirect you to a PDF of my resume where the user can download it. Media Queries were included for accessibility on different media platforms. The first image link is larger than the other images in the gallery. I also included comments to organize the code for each section of the Webpage.
